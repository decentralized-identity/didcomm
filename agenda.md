_For this call, you are encouraged to turn your video on. This is a good way to build rapport given we are a large, disparate group experiencing a lot of churn._

_This document is live-edited DURING each call, and stable/authoritative copies live on our github repo under /agenda.md . 
Please note that we might not notice a pullrequest in time, but you are free to propose agenda items for future meetings via hackmd._

### Agenda

- Welcome / Introductions

- Status Updates

  * Potential DIDComm Users Group

  * IIW Sessions Review
      * Tour of DIDComm Libraries - Alex & Slava
      * DIDComm Mythconceptions - Daniel
      * Future of DIDComm -> IETF Movement (didn't happen)
      * DIDComm Protocols - Sam
      * Moving medical data over DIDComm - community member
      * P2PLib & DIDComm - Oliver 
  
- Sam mentioned that DIDComm V3 could specify how to start a "cryptographic" session that could be synchronous and very efficient.

- There is a general sense that the next version of DIDComm will be at IETF. But DIF can still remain the home of the DIDComm User's Group. The User's Group can become the focus for implementation help, maintain didcomm.org, and work on the Implementer's Guide.
